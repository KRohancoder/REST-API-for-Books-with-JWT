# REST-API-for-Books-with-JWT
simple REST API for managing a list of books using Django, along with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for securing the API endpoints.

Ensure python / Django is installed.

Use cd to navigate to the django-bookfinder directory that contains manage.py in it.

Run python manage.py runserver in the terminal to start the server.

Once it starts running on your local server, append /book/search to the url to get to something like http://0.0.0.0:8000/book/search/

You should be able to then type something into the search bar and search for a book!
